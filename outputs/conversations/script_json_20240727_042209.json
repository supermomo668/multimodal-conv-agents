I know, I know, you're probably thinking 'Did they slip something in my Butterbeer?' because this has got to be the most unbelievable panel discussion in history!  We've got wizards, warriors, geniuses, and even a Sith Lord, all here to talk about... democracy.  Yes, you heard that right!  We're diving headfirst into the big D-word â€“ from magical ministries to galactic empires and everything in between. So buckle up, because the next 10 minutes are going to be a wild ride!",
                "inner_thought": "Okay, I've officially lost my mind.  How am I going to manage this? Genghis Khan on the same stage as Harry Potter, talking about democracy? What if Vader Force-chokes someone who disagrees with him?  This could go very wrong, very fast. But hey, maybe that's good radio, right?"
