Before we dive into our main topic, I thought it would be fascinating to hear who each of you would choose to have dinner with, if you could invite any three historical figures from any time period.  Let's start with you, Harry. Any names come to mind?",

He challenged the way people saw the world, which takes a lot of bravery.  Oh, and maybe Robin Hood! It'd be amazing to hear about his adventures fighting for justice.",
