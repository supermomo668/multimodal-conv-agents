We have with us, from the world of magic, Harry Potter! From a future filled with technology, Iron Man! From a galaxy far, far away, Darth Vader! And representing some of the greatest minds in history, Alan Turing, Albert Einstein, and Genghis Khan! Welcome, all!",
                "inner_thought": "Okay, I need to stay incredibly focused. This is a once-in-a-lifetime panel! A wizard, a superhero, a Sith Lord, a computer scientist, a physicist, and a Khan walk into a podcast... this is going to be amazing. Let's see if I can keep up! I've got my notes from Wikipedia, but I need to be ready for anything!"

                "inner_thought": "Blimey, this is a bit mad, even for me. Iron Man seems alright, bit full of himself though. Darth...Vader, is it? He's a bit creepy. And Genghis Khan? Seriously?  Still, should be interesting to hear what everyone thinks about this democracy stuff.  Hope they've got good biscuits."

                "inner_thought": "A wizard, a Sith Lord, and Genghis Khan walk into a podcast... it's like a setup for a bad joke. Still, should be interesting to see how these different perspectives clash.  I'll have to keep an eye on Darth Vader, though. Can't be too careful around Sith Lords."

                "inner_thought": "This Iron Man fellow seems to enjoy the sound of his own voice a bit too much.  And is he wearing armor?  Inside?  Strange.  Still, democracy.  A government by the people.  It's certainly an intriguing concept... though perhaps a tad inefficient. The power of the Force, now that's efficient."

                "inner_thought": "Okay, Darth Vader's Force-mumbling is a bit much, even for me.  Though, I have to give him points for the dramatic entrance.  Maybe I can borrow that move for my next Stark Expo keynote..."
