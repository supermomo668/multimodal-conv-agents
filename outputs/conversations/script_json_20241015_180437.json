Harry's experiences with authoritarianism under the Ministry of Magic and then Voldemort's regime will likely inform his views on the importance of individual rights and resisting tyranny."

Tony's experiences with the arc reactor technology, weapons manufacturing, and ultimately, the Avengers, will likely lead to a complex and potentially controversial stance on power, responsibility, and the role of technology in governance."

Vader's journey offers a cautionary tale about the seductive nature of power and the dangers of authoritarianism. His insights into the Galactic Empire's rise and fall will be invaluable, though potentially chilling."

Genghis Khan's perspective on leadership, power, and the unification (albeit through force) of disparate tribes will provide a provocative counterpoint to modern democratic ideals."

Though, I can't shake this feeling that my work on the Enigma machine, vital as it was, pales in comparison to the mysteries of the universe Einstein pondered.  And democracy...  a double-edged sword it seems.  Capable of great good, yet it failed to protect those like me."

Though, I will say, the idea of everyone getting a voice?  Not the worst starting point. Especially when you've seen what happens when power gets concentrated in the wrong hands.",
