        "# AgentOptimizer: An Agentic Way to Train Your LLM Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
        "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
        "\n",
        "In traditional ML pipeline, we train a model by updating its parameter according to the loss on the training set, while in the era of LLM agents, how should we train an agent? Here, we take an initial step towards the agent training. Inspired by the [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) capabilities provided by OpenAI, we draw an analogy between model parameters and agent functions/skills, and update agent’s functions/skills based on its historical performance on the training set. As an agentic way of training an agent, our approach help enhance the agents’ abilities without requiring access to the LLMs parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we introduce a new class, ‘AgentOptimizer’, which is able to improve the function list of one Assistant-UserProxy pair according to the historical conversation histories.\n",
        "This feature would support agents in improving their ability to solve problems of the same type as previous tasks.\n",
        "Specifically, given a set of training data, AgentOptimizer would iteratively prompt the LLM to optimize the existing function list of the AssistantAgent and UserProxyAgent with code implementation if necessary. It also includes two strategies, roll-back, and early-stop, to streamline the training process.\n",
        "In the example scenario, we test the proposed AgentOptimizer in solving problems from the [MATH dataset](https://github.com/hendrycks/math).\n",
