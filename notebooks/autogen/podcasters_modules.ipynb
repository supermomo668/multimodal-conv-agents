      "\n",
      "**Output Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "**Harry Potter:** Harry James Potter is the titular protagonist of J. K. Rowling's fantasy series. Born on 31 July 1980, he is orphaned at one year old and is unknowingly left on the doorstep of his neglectful and abusive muggle aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon Dursley and their spoiled son Dudley, after Lord Voldemort (Tom Marvolo Riddle) murdered his parents, James and Lily Potter, but failed to kill Harry as well because of his mother's loving sacrifice. Known for bravery, intelligence.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "**Iron Man:** Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Known for bravery, intelligence, visionary thinking.\n",

      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Real-Time Constraints:**  Keep in mind a 10-minute podcast at 120 WPM allows for about 1200 words total.  The host's intro, questions, and guest responses will all need to fit within this limit. \n",
      "* **Wikipedia's Limitations:** Wikipedia summaries are a starting point.  For fictional characters, exploring dedicated wikis (like Harry Potter Wiki) might provide more relevant details.\n",
      "* **Personality Analysis:** The current `get_personality_traits` function is rudimentary.  For more nuanced insights, consider incorporating sentiment analysis and more sophisticated natural language processing techniques. \n",
