      "Harry James Potter is the titular protagonist of J. K. Rowling's fantasy series, Harry Potter. The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Each book chronicles one year in Harry's life, the main narrative arc concerning Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people). \n",

      "Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). Anthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark is a genius inventor, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist who is the CEO of Stark Industries. At the heart of the character since his inception is the idea that modern technology, even in the wrong hands, can solve anything. \n",

      "## Darth Vader:\n",
      "Darth Vader is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. He is the central antagonist in the original trilogy and, as Anakin Skywalker, is a primary protagonist in the prequel trilogy. The character was created by George Lucas and has been portrayed by numerous actors. His appearances as a major character span the first six Star Wars films, and he appears briefly in the sequel trilogy. He is an iconic villain in popular culture, ranked as one of the greatest villains and fictional characters ever. \n",

      "## Alan Turing:\n",
      "Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 ‚Äì 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician and computer scientist who made fundamental advances in theoretical computer science by providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. During World War II, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he was head of Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Albert Einstein:\n",
      "Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 ‚Äì 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass‚Äìenergy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. \n",

      "Genghis Khan (born Tem√ºjin, c.‚Äâ1158 ‚Äì 18 August 1227) was the founder and first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in history after his death. He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. After founding the Empire and being proclaimed \"Genghis Khan\", he started the Mongol invasions that conquered most of Eurasia. Campaigns beginning in the reign of Genghis Khan and continuing under his successors, such as √ñgedei Khan and Kublai Khan, would ultimately expand Mongol rule across most of modern-day China, Korea, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and substantial portions of modern Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Middle East.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Framing the Conversation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Acknowledge the elephant (or dragon) in the room:** Start by recognizing the absurdity of the gathering.  A lighthearted tone will make the conversation more approachable.\n",
      "* **Democracy ‚Äì A Broad Term:**  Define what aspects of democracy you'll discuss (elections, individual rights, governance styles, etc.) as these figures come from magical societies, futuristic worlds, and periods with vastly different power structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Guest Cheat Sheet:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Harry Potter:** Represents fighting for good against overwhelming odds. Likely idealistic about democratic values but lacks real-world political experience.\n",
      "* **Iron Man (Tony Stark):**  A billionaire inventor, his views might be colored by privilege. Potential for discussion on technology's role in democracy, for good or ill.\n",
      "* **Darth Vader:**  A reformed tyrant! His perspective on the dangers of unchecked power and the allure of authoritarianism would be fascinating, albeit potentially chilling.\n",
      "* **Alan Turing:**  A genius mathematician and codebreaker.  Could speak to the importance of information freedom and the dangers of surveillance in a democratic society.\n",
      "* **Albert Einstein:**  A renowned physicist, likely to approach the topic from a philosophical and ethical standpoint.  Could discuss the responsibility of individuals to a just society.\n",
      "* **Genghis Khan:** Founded a vast empire through military might.  His views on centralized vs. decentralized power would be invaluable, though likely at odds with modern democratic ideals. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Managing the Discussion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Short, Sharp Questions:**  With such limited time, questions need to be focused to elicit diverse responses.\n",
      "* **Embrace the Chaos (to a Point):**  Disagreement is inevitable. Encourage respectful debate but be ready to steer the conversation if it goes off the rails.\n",
      "* **Leave the Audience Wanting More:**  10 minutes is barely enough time to scratch the surface. End with a thought-provoking question or unresolved tension to inspire further reflection. \n",
